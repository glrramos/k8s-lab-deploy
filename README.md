# k8s-lab-deploy
Vagrant + VirtualBox deployment of Kubernetes Cluster

# Vagrant Kubernetes Cluster Lab Setup for CKA 

This project uses Vagrant to create a local Kubernetes cluster consisting of a master node and one or more worker nodes. The configuration is managed using Ruby code in a `Vagrantfile`, with external variables defined in a separate `variables` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Ruby (for parsing the Vagrantfile)
- Necessary Vagrant plugins (if required)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Edit the `variables` file:** Configure the necessary `variables` in the variables file to match your environment and requirements. This includes settings like Kubernetes version, IP addresses, and resource allocations.

3. **Start the Vagrant environment:** To create and provision the VMs, run:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

4. **Access the master node:** You can SSH into the master node using:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh <MASTER_NAME>
   ```

5. **Access the worker node:** Similarly, to SSH into the worker node:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh <WORKER_NAME>
   ```

## Configuration

The Vagrantfile includes the following key components:

- Master Node Configuration:
    - Static IP configuration.
    - Shell provisioning scripts for network configuration, Kubernetes preparation, and master node setup.
    - Kubernetes Master bootstrapped with kubeadm.
    - Cilium is used as Network Plug-in.

- Worker Node Configuration:
    - Static IP configuration.
    - Shell provisioning scripts for network configuration, Kubernetes preparation, and joining the worker node to the cluster.
    - Kubernetes Worker bootstrapped with kubeadm.

- VirtualBox Provider Configuration:
    - Customizes the VM settings, such as CPU, memory, and graphics controller.

## Variables

The configuration relies on several variables defined in an external `variables` file. Ensure to set the following variables:

- `MASTER_NAME`: Name of the master node.
- `WORKER_NAME`: Name of the worker node.
- `BOX`: The base Vagrant box to use.
- `MASTER_IP`: Static IP for the master node.
- `WORKER_IP`: Static IP for the worker node.
- `GATEWAY`: Network gateway address.
- `DNS`: DNS server address.
- `DOMAIN`: Domain name for the cluster.
- `KUBERNETES_VERSION`: Version of Kubernetes to install.
- `ADVERTISE_ADDRESS`: Address for the master node to advertise.
- `ENDPOINT_NAME`: Control plane endpoint.
- `POD_SUBNET`: Pod network CIDR for Kubernetes.
- `CILIUM_VERSION`: Version of Cilium to install.
- `MEMORY`: Memory allocation for each VM.
- `CPU`: CPU allocation for each VM.

## Scripts

**`network.sh`**

This script configures the network settings for the master and worker nodes using `netplan`.

- **Network Configuration:** It sets up a private network interface with a static IP and routing.
- **Permissions**: Changes permissions for network configuration files.
- **Application of Configuration:** Applies the network configuration using netplan apply.

**`k8s-preparation.sh`**

This script prepares the system for Kubernetes installation.

- **System Update:** Updates package repositories and upgrades the system.
- **Package Installation:** Installs necessary packages, including kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl.
- **Swap Disablement:** Disables swap to meet Kubernetes requirements.
- **Kernel Module Loading:** Loads necessary kernel modules for container runtime.
- **Container Runtime Configuration:** Installs and configures `containerd` with required settings.
- **Kubernetes Repository Setup:** Adds the Kubernetes APT repository and installs Kubernetes components.
- **Hosts Configuration:** Updates `/etc/hosts` to include the master node's advertise address and hostname.

**`setup-master.sh`**

This script sets up the master node and initializes the Kubernetes cluster.

- **Kubernetes Initialization:** Initializes the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm init with a generated configuration file.
- **Cilium Installation:** Installs Cilium as the pod network plugin using Helm.
- **Join Command Generation:** Saves the kubeadm join command for worker nodes in a script named `join-worker.sh`.
- **Kubernetes Configuration:** Configures the `kubectl` CLI for the Vagrant user to manage the cluster.

**`join-worker.sh`**

This script is auto-generated by the vagrant during Master setup.

- **Join Kubernetes Worker Node:** Joins Worker node to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Directory Structure
The project has the following directory structure:

    k8s-lab-deploy
    ├───kubernetes-configuration-files
    ├───outputs
    ├───scripts
    └───templates
    
### Description of Folders:
- **`k8s-lab-deploy`:** Main folder that holds all the project. `Vagrantfile` and `variables.rb` are located here.

- **`kubernetes-configuration-files`:** This folder contains generated Kubernetes configuration files used during the cluster setup.

- **`outputs`:** Contains output logs and files generated during the execution of various scripts, including logs from `kubeadm init`.

- **`scripts`:** Contains the shell scripts responsible for configuring the network, preparing the system for Kubernetes, and setting up the master node.

- **`templates`:** This folder is expected to contain YAML templates that are used during the Kubernetes setup, such as the `kubeadm-config-template.yaml`.

## Changes Made:

- Added the text about editing the `variables` file to the **Usage**.
- Added a new **Scripts** section with descriptions for `network.sh`, `k8s-preparation.sh`, `setup-master.sh`, and `join-worker.sh`.
